TASK 1

Imagine you're creating a super-smart system to help people set up appointments with doctors in different clinics. You can pick a doctor you like and find a convenient time slot. Also, if you have a favorite doctor, you can specifically choose them. This system needs to keep track of when and where these appointments happen.

Here's the twist: Some doctors work in more than one clinic, and clinics can have multiple doctors. Also, you can set up appointments in different clinics with different doctors if you need to. The tricky part is that the system should be really good at helping you find the right doctor

Design a Database, where

⚫ Patient can book an appointment at a clinic for a given time slot doctors who are free during that time slot (of that clinic) will be allocated

⚫ Patient can book an appointment with a specific Doctor

⚫ Appointment can be booked for a particular time slot

. One doctor can work in multiple clinics

. One clinic can have multiple Doctors One patient can book multiple appointments at multiple clinics with

multiple Doctors

You can use draw io to describe the HLD and LLD of the system.
